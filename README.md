# Traffic-Racer

This project consists of my recreation of the well-known Traffic Racer game where the player is able to race other computer-generated cars that simulate a thrilling highway race. The goal of the game is to drive as long as possible without hitting other cars. To do this I implemented collision detection that tracks whenever the player's car collides with another car, which will subsequently end the current run.

To simulate an actual race, an infinite scrolling screen and computer-generated cars moving at varying speeds relative to the moving screen are implemented. This helps give the player the effect of actually driving on a highway. Additionally, the player is able to use the left and right arrow keys to move between lanes, and the up and down arrow buttons to increase or decrease their speed in-game.

Additional features are also implemented such as sound effects, music, a settings menu, and so on.

This game was programmed using Python along with the pygame library. Feel free to check out the game code in the Traffic Racer.py game file!
